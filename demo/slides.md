Speaker Notes:
Good [morning/afternoon], professors and recruitment professionals. Today I'm presenting our research on AI-powered recruitment systems that addresses a critical gap in the literature—the systematic false rejection of qualified candidates.

Our multi-agent system represents a novel approach to semantic skill matching, achieving a 76% reduction in false rejection rates with statistical significance. Let me begin with a real case study from our field research...

Speaker Script:
During our seminar project last semester, we documented a case that perfectly illustrates the research problem. Two candidates applied for a C# backend engineer position through the same ATS.

[Point to screen] Moon had 6 years of .NET experience. Ca had 8 years in low-latency systems, was a Microsoft MVP, with demonstrable impact metrics. However, Ca typed 'C #' with a space—a syntactic variation the keyword-based system couldn't recognize.

The deterministic algorithm rejected Ca in 0.8 seconds. No recruiter reviewed his qualifications. This isn't just anecdotal—our analysis shows the company subsequently spent $420,000 on contractors and experienced service outages that Ca's expertise could have prevented.

This aligns with Fuller et al.'s (2021) findings at Harvard Business School, showing 12-35% false rejection rates across the industry. For recruitment teams here, this means you're potentially missing one in three qualified candidates due to algorithmic limitations, not human judgment.

Our research question became: How can we design an AI system that understands semantic equivalence and transferable skills while maintaining recruiter autonomy? Let me show you our solution.

Speaker Script:
Let me present our systematic analysis of the false rejection phenomenon. Our literature review, building on Fuller et al. (2021) and OECD Employment Outlook (2023), confirms false rejection rates between 12-35% across different ATS implementations. This represents a significant gap between recruiter intentions and system outcomes.

88% of executives acknowledge that their screening technology is filtering out qualified candidates. The economic impact—$750K to $3.45M per 100 hires—reflects not just delayed hiring but missed talent opportunities. And 73% of those wrongly rejected candidates? They're getting hired by your competitors.

From a research perspective, we've identified critical patterns that explain these failures. Let me show you the three fundamental flaws we discovered...

Speaker Script:
Our research identified three fundamental architectural flaws that create these massive false rejection rates.

First, Static Keywords. [Click] Current systems use lexical matching—they literally look for exact text matches. They can't understand that "Python" and "Python Developer" refer to the same competency. This creates a 40-60% miss rate for qualified candidates who use slightly different terminology. It's like rejecting someone who says "car" when you're looking for "automobile."

Second, Homogeneity Bias. [Click] These algorithms encode societal biases against non-traditional backgrounds. Career gaps? Automatic rejection. Military to civilian transition? 67% higher rejection rate. The very diversity companies claim to want is systematically filtered out by their tools.

Third, Black-Box Scoring. [Click] No transparency, no explainability. The same resume submitted twice can get different scores. Recruiters can't understand why decisions were made or correct obvious errors. This violates basic principles of explainable AI and creates random, unfair outcomes.

These aren't bugs—they're fundamental design flaws. And they compound each other. Let me show you exactly how this plays out in a typical screening workflow...

[Point to diagram] This workflow diagram, based on our analysis of 250 real applications, illustrates three critical failure points. Notice how tokenization errors (E₁), Boolean false negatives (E₂), and ranking cutoffs (E₃) compound to reduce the candidate pool from 250 to just 18—a 93% reduction. Our statistical analysis indicates 30-53 qualified candidates are eliminated through these systematic errors.

For recruitment professionals, this creates an impossible situation: you're held accountable for hiring quality, yet the tools meant to help you are actively working against you. 

These findings led us to propose a fundamentally different architecture based on multi-agent systems and semantic understanding.

Speaker Script:
Our research contributes three novel solutions to address each identified architectural flaw. These aren't incremental improvements—they represent a paradigm shift in how recruitment systems process candidate information.

First, our Semantic Skill Matcher addresses the lexical matching problem through vector embeddings and a custom-built ontology of 30,000+ technical terms. Using transformer-based models, we achieve semantic similarity scores—for example, 'Software Developer' and 'Software Engineer' show 0.94 cosine similarity. In our controlled experiments, this reduced false negatives from 40-60% to under 15%, with p < 0.001.

Second, the Career Translator module tackles representation bias through transfer learning. We trained our model on successful career transitions, enabling it to map competencies across domains. For recruitment teams, this means when you see a military logistics officer applying for supply chain roles, the system surfaces relevant skills like 'resource optimization' and 'team leadership.' Our data shows a 340% increase in non-traditional candidate progression, particularly benefiting veterans and career changers.

Third, we implemented Explainable AI principles through our Decision Explainer. Every recommendation includes interpretable rationales and confidence scores. Recruiters can see exactly why decisions were made and provide corrections that improve the model. This addresses the critical trust gap—our user studies show 3x higher consistency in recruiter decisions when using our explainable system versus black-box alternatives.

The integration of these three components through our multi-agent architecture is where the real innovation lies. Let me demonstrate how they work together.

Speaker Script:
Our multi-agent architecture represents a significant contribution to both AI systems research and recruitment technology. [Point to diagram] This isn't a monolithic system—it's six specialized agents with distinct responsibilities, communicating through a message-passing protocol.

The Supervisor Agent implements a hierarchical task decomposition algorithm, breaking job requirements into semantic evaluation criteria. This draws from recent advances in LLM-based planning, but adapted for the recruitment domain.

The Screening Agent operationalizes our semantic matching research using BERT-based embeddings in a 1536-dimensional vector space. The Critic Agent runs in parallel, implementing our bias detection algorithms and transfer learning models. This dual-evaluation approach is inspired by adversarial networks but designed for interpretability.

For recruitment professionals, here's what this means practically: When you post a job, the system doesn't just match keywords. It understands that 'built microservices' implies knowledge of containerization, API design, and distributed systems. When candidates are evaluated, you get not one but two independent assessments—reducing both false positives and false negatives.

The HITL Agent is crucial for maintaining recruiter autonomy. It uses confidence intervals and disagreement metrics to route only the genuinely ambiguous cases to human review. Our studies show this reduces recruiter workload by 75% while improving decision quality.

The Data Steward ensures GDPR compliance and implements our continual learning pipeline. Every recruiter correction becomes training data, improving system performance over time. Using Redis for state management and Milvus for vector operations, we achieve sub-5-minute processing per candidate while maintaining full auditability.

Speaker Script:
Let me present three use cases from our empirical evaluation, demonstrating both research validity and practical application.

First, automated screening represents 70-80% of cases in our test cohort. The system achieves 94.9% accuracy on clear matches and non-matches, with confidence scores above 0.85. For recruitment teams, this means your routine screening—which currently takes hours—is reduced to 3-5 minutes with higher accuracy than manual review. Every decision includes an audit trail for compliance.

Second, our HITL protocol handles 15-20% of cases where either confidence < 0.70 or agent disagreement > 0.35. This is a key research contribution: instead of binary accept/reject, we implement a confidence-based triage system. Recruiters receive structured decision support—for example, 'Screening: 0.65 match on required skills. Critic: 0.78 match including transferable competencies from finance domain.' Our user studies show recruiters make better decisions with this dual-perspective input.

Third, our bias detection runs continuously using statistical parity and equalized odds metrics. When demographic patterns exceed threshold values, the system triggers re-evaluation. In testing, we identified cases where military veterans were systematically underscored and corrected this through our transfer learning module.

The innovation here is the integration—these aren't independent features but a cohesive system. Bias detection can promote cases to HITL review. Recruiter corrections update both the matching models and bias baselines. This creates a learning system that improves with use while maintaining human oversight.

For researchers, this demonstrates practical AI-human collaboration. For recruiters, it means technology that enhances rather than replaces your expertise.

Speaker Script:
Our experimental results demonstrate both statistical significance and practical impact. Let me present the key findings.

In our controlled comparison using identical candidate pools, the baseline keyword-matching system showed a false rejection rate of 30.8% (95% CI: 28.2-33.4%). Our multi-agent system achieved 7.4% (95% CI: 5.8-9.0%). This 76% relative improvement is statistically significant with χ² = 43.86, p < 0.001.

To contextualize these numbers: From 971 candidates, the baseline correctly identified 380 qualified individuals. Our system identified 608 qualified candidates from 885—a 60% improvement in recall while maintaining comparable precision. The difference is particularly pronounced for non-traditional candidates, where we achieved 82% recall versus the baseline's 31%.

Our analysis revealed 27 'hidden gems'—candidates with exceptional qualifications but non-standard backgrounds. Qualitative analysis showed these included career changers with strong domain expertise and self-taught developers with significant open-source contributions.

Effect size analysis yields Cohen's h = 0.625, indicating a large practical effect. For recruitment teams, this translates to finding 6 additional qualified candidates for every 10 positions, dramatically expanding your talent pool.

Scalability analysis: At 10,000 annual applications, this reduces false rejections from ~3,080 to ~740 candidates. Combined with processing time reduction from 23 to 8 hours per hire, the system delivers both quality and efficiency improvements.

These results held across all eight job categories and demographic groups, validating our bias mitigation approach.

Speaker Script:
Let's return to Ca from our opening story. Right now, as we speak, you likely have dozens—maybe hundreds—of candidates just like Ca sitting in your ATS reject pile. Talented people who could transform your teams, but who were filtered out by a space, a synonym, or a non-traditional background.

For talent acquisition teams, this isn't just about technology—it's about competitive advantage. When you reject Ca, your competitor gains a Microsoft MVP who prevents $420K disasters. When you miss military veterans with transferable skills, you lose leaders who excel under pressure. The 73% of wrongly rejected candidates who join competitors? They're building products that compete with yours.

Our system changes this dynamic completely. You'll discover 25% more qualified candidates—not by lowering standards, but by actually understanding skills. You'll save $150,000 per 100 hires while reducing screening time by 90%. Most importantly, you'll build stronger, more diverse teams by accessing talent pools that keyword matching systematically excludes.

Here's how we make this real: Start with a 2-week pilot using your actual job openings. We'll show you the 'Ca's' you're currently missing—real candidates with names and faces, not statistics. Our API integrates with Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, and other major platforms. No disruption, just better results.

For talent acquisition leaders, this is your opportunity to transform recruitment from a cost center to a competitive advantage. For researchers, this demonstrates how AI can enhance rather than replace human judgment.

The question isn't whether AI will change recruitment—it's whether you'll lead that change or follow it. Let's ensure you never lose another Ca.

Thank you for your time. I'm here to answer any questions about implementation, research methodology, or how we can help you find your hidden talent.
