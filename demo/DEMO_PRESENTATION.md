### Slide 5: Live Demonstration (8 min)

#### Scenario 1: Perfect Match (2 min)
**Setup**: Senior Python Developer position vs experienced candidate
**Demo**: Show built-in demo mode
**Results**: 
- 95% confidence score
- All skills matched with high confidence
- No human review needed
- Clear "proceed to next round" recommendation

#### Scenario 2: Hidden Gem Discovery (4 min)
**Setup**: Data Scientist position vs career changer from finance
**Demo**: Upload custom job description and resume
**Results**:
