### Demo Script

#### Introduction (2 minutes)
- "Today I'll demonstrate our AI-powered Multi-Agent Recruitment System"
- "This system reduces false rejection rates by using specialized AI agents"
- "We'll see three scenarios: perfect match, hidden gem, and clear rejection"

#### Scenario 1: Perfect Match (5 minutes)
1. Upload Jane Smith's resume and Senior Python Developer job description
2. Click "evaluate" and walk through loading indicators
3. Highlight key results:
   - High confidence score (95%+)
   - Perfect skill matches with confidence bars
   - Experience exceeds requirements
   - No bias flags detected
   - "Proceed to next round" recommendation

#### Scenario 2: Hidden Gem (7 minutes)
1. Upload Marcus Rodriguez's resume and Data Scientist job description
2. Show evaluation process with step-by-step loading
3. Emphasize critical review findings:
   - Moderate screening score but higher critic score
   - Bias flags: career changer, non-traditional education
   - Transferable skills identified (finance → data science)
   - "Human review required" with detailed reasoning
4. Explain why this prevents false rejection

#### Scenario 3: Poor Match (3 minutes)
1. Upload Alex Chen's resume and Senior DevOps Engineer job description
2. Demonstrate clear rejection case:
   - Low confidence scores across all metrics
   - Major skill gaps identified
   - Experience level mismatch
   - Clear "not recommended" decision

#### System Architecture Overview (3 minutes)
- Brief explanation of multi-agent approach
- Show how each agent contributes (Supervisor, Screening, Critic, HITL)
