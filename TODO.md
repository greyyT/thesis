# To do

## Part 1 - introduction

### 1.1 - reasons for choosing the topic

- [x] Add government/academic sources (ILO, OECD, Bureau of Labor Statistics) @lelouvincx
- [x] Technology is proposed as the solution. However, the insights from survey emphasize "quality candidates" and "retention" @greyy-nguyen (the old version didn't mention that using AI will give time for HR to do strategic tasks, but the new version does).
- [ ] Assumes AI automation is superior without comparing to improved human processes @greyy-nguyen

### 1.2 - problem space

- [ ] Content for this part @greyy-nguyen

  - Current ATS fail because of rigid keyword matching → Multi-agent system uses contextual understanding
  - Single-point decisions create bias → Multiple specialized agents provide checks and balances
  - Lack of transparency → Explainable AI with audit trails

- [x] Problem space @lelouvincx

- [ ] @lelouvincx to find suitable dataset for evaluating success metrics: Time-to-hire reduction percentage, Quality-of-hire scores, Diversity metrics improvement, False negative reduction rate

  - [x] Approach: Since no time, Find datasets first, find out the evaluation method of those datasets, then design the problem statement based on the evaluation method

- [ ] @lelouvincx to reference OECD AI Principles explicitly when discussing your human-in-the-loop system design, particularly Principles 2 (human-centered values) and 5 (accountability), https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/ai-principles.html

### 1.3 - problem statement

- [x] @lelouvincx to write problem statement

## Part 2 - Theory

- [ ] @greyy-nguyen to write the theory part
  - [ ] Multi-agent system
  - [ ] Explainable AI
  - [ ] Human-in-the-loop
  - [ ] Human resources management

## Part 3 - Evaluation Framework

- [ ] @lelouvincx to describe how existing ATS systems screen candidates
- [ ] @lelouvincx to explain how ATS systems are at average 12-25% false rejection rate
  - What's the metric? How is it calculated?
  - On which dataset? Can I simulate that dataset?
  - Drawbacks of ATS systems
- [ ] @lelouvincx to show how the proposed core system screens candidates
  - Address what existing problems of ATS systems?
  - Any proofs?

## Part 4 - High-level Design

- [x] @lelouvincx to write the high-level system architecture design
- [x] @lelouvincx to draw use-case diagram
- [x] @lelouvincx to describe the use-case diagram
- [x] @lelouvincx to synthesize all diagrams to one System Architecture Diagram
