# To do

## Part 1 - introduction

### 1.1 - reason choosing the topic

- [ ] Add government/academic sources (ILO, OECD, Bureau of Labor Statistics) @lelouvincx
- [x] Technology is proposed as the solution. However, the insights from survey emphasize "quality candidates" and "retention" @greyy-nguyen (the old version didn't mention that using AI will give time for HR to do strategic tasks, but the new version does).
- [ ] Assumes AI automation is superior without comparing to improved human processes @greyy-nguyen

### 1.2 - problem statement

- [ ] Write problem statement @lelouvincx

- [ ] Find suitable dataset for evaluating success metrics: Time-to-hire reduction percentage, Quality-of-hire scores, Diversity metrics improvement, False negative reduction rate @lelouvincx

- [ ] Content for this part @greyy-nguyen
  - Current ATS fail because of rigid keyword matching → Multi-agent system uses contextual understanding
  - Single-point decisions create bias → Multiple specialized agents provide checks and balances
  - Lack of transparency → Explainable AI with audit trails
