# Chapter 5: Implementation and Evaluation

## 5.1 Data Preparation

### Dataset Overview

We employ a unified resume dataset comprising **1,182 expert-labeled records** from various sources, manually annotated by HR professionals and recruitment specialists. The dataset covers eight technology roles:

- Frontend Developer
- Backend Developer
- Python Developer
- Data Scientist
- Full Stack Developer
- Mobile App Developer (iOS/Android)
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Cloud Engineer

Each resume contains unstructured natural language text mirroring real-world job applications, including education, skills, experience, projects, and certifications.

### Selection Rationale

This dataset aligns with our research objectives for the following reasons:

1. **Expert Annotation**: HR professionals provide reliable ground truth labels
2. **Statistical Power**: 1,182 samples enable meaningful performance evaluation
3. **Balanced Coverage**: ~148 resumes per job category ensure unbiased assessment
4. **Real-World Validity**: Authentic formats and content variations reflect actual recruitment scenarios
5. **False Rejection Analysis**: Sufficient diversity to identify patterns where traditional systems fail
